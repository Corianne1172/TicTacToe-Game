# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with MiniMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game with two computer algorithms: **MiniMax** and **MiniMax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**. The game can be played either **human vs computer** or **computer vs computer**.

## Features

- Tic-Tac-Toe game on a 3x3 grid
- MiniMax adversarial search algorithm
- MiniMax with Alpha-Beta pruning for optimized performance
- Command-line interface for gameplay
- Node counter to track the number of search tree nodes generated by the computer

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Running the Game

Clone the repository (or navigate to your local copy):

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd TicTacToe-Game
```

Run the game with the following command format:

```bash
python3 CS480_P01_A20541182.py ALGO FIRST MODE
```

Where:

- `ALGO`:
  - `1` – MiniMax
  - `2` – MiniMax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- `FIRST`:
  - `X` – X moves first
  - `O` – O moves first
- `MODE`:
  - `1` – Human vs Computer
  - `2` – Computer vs Computer

### Examples

**Local example path (my setup):**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/TicTacToe-Game
python3 CS480_P01_A20541182.py 1 X 1
python3 CS480_P01_A20541182.py 2 X 1
```

**General example for any system:**

```bash
cd TicTacToe-Game
python3 CS480_P01_A20541182.py 1 X 1   # Play using MiniMax, human goes first
python3 CS480_P01_A20541182.py 2 O 2   # Play using MiniMax with Alpha-Beta, computer goes first
```

## Gameplay

- The board is displayed as a 3x3 grid.
- If it's the human player's turn, you will be prompted to choose a move from the list of available positions (1–9).
- The computer displays its selected move and the number of nodes it generated during the search.
- The game ends when either player wins or there is a tie.

## Node Count Analysis

MiniMax with Alpha-Beta pruning significantly reduces the number of nodes explored compared to standard MiniMax, making it more efficient while producing the same optimal moves.
